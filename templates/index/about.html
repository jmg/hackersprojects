<h3>About</h3>

<div class="content">

<p><strong>Hackers Projects</strong> is a github projects <strong>aggregator</strong> where the developers are able to share, vote, comment and contribute open source projects generated by the community itself. It's a kind of hackersnews-like site but for open source projects hosted on <strong>github</strong>.</p>

<p>It is and it will always be completely <strong>open source</strong>. You can contribute with bug fixing, new features, a better design (I'm a developer and my lack of design / css abilities are certainly reflected on the bootstrapy aspect this site has right now). The gihub repository is the following <a href="https://github.com/jmg/hackersprojects">https://github.com/jmg/hackersprojects</a>. Feel free to send me a <strong>pull request</strong> and let's make this project grow as a community of open source projects and developers!</p>

<p>The idea is to fund this project via donations. Read more on the <a href="/donations/">donations page</a>. </p>
